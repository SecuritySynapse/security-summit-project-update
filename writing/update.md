## Project Overview

This long-term project invites you to propose, implement, evaluate, and present
your own advanced project in the field of computer security. In addition to
requiring the completion of a significant and innovative software tool, this
project invites you to complete a series of presentations and reports. Your
proposed project should clearly demonstrate a "security synapse" both through
the connection between high-level concepts and their low-level implementation
and technical concepts discussed in the course and their practical application
to the secure use of real-world computer software. You may use external sources,
including artificial intelligence coding assistants and online forums, during
the completion of this project provided that you cite these sources and explain
how you used them to complete the various components of your proposed project.

## Status Update Instructions

Provide a brief status updates about your progress on the security summit
project. Please note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository
has a passing build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have
adequately answered all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to
each of them. It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory
answers to all of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment
of your security synapse project proposal.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive proposal for your security synapse project.

### Project Update

#### What is the final topic that you selected for your security summit project?

TODO: Write two or three sentences that offer an overview of your topic, explain
what you are going to build, and describe how you are going to evaluate it. What
you furnish in this sub-section of the proposal should include a few more
details than the topic list that you provided in the previous sub-section.

- **Chosen Topic**: 

#### What are the ways in which your project's topic evolved since its proposal?

TODO: Write a one-paragraph description of how your project's topic evolved since
you first proposed it. This response should explain how your project's topic
changed from both a high-level perspective and in terms of the specific
technical details that are central to the completion of your project.

#### What are the scientific and/or engineering goals for your chosen project?

TODO: Provide a list of at least three goals for your chosen project. Each goal
that you provide should have a clear noun and verb. Whenever it is possible to
do so, please make sure that you do not write any of these goals in passive
voice as that would obscure the overall contributions of your project.

#### What is the abstract of your project proposal?

TODO: Write a one-paragraph abstract that overviews your proposed project and
the expected outcomes. The content that you write here should be written and
formatted like the abstract of a scientific paper published in an ACM or IEEE
conference in the field of computer security. The one different between an
abstract that you read in a published research paper and this abstract is that
the one you are writing here will reference expected research results and a
published paper will explain the results from a completed study.

#### What are the components of your system that you are going to design and implement?

TODO: Write a one or two paragraph response to this question. Your response
should highlight the names of the system components that you are going to build,
the way in which you are going to design each specific component, and then a
checklist of steps that you will take to actually implement and test that
component. Whenever possible, please make sure that you state the specific
implementation frameworks, programming languages, and tools that you will use to
design and implement each component in your proposed system.

#### What is some convincing evidence of feasibility for your proposed project?

TODO: Along with furnishing two fenced code blocks, write a one or two paragraph
response to this question. Your response to this question should contain at
least two fenced code blocks. The first fenced code block should contain a code
snippet that demonstrates the feasibility of your proposed project. The second
fenced code block should contain the output from running the code snippet. The
code segment that you furnish should make it clear that it is possible for
you to complete the proposed project during the remainder of the academic
semester. After you have finished both of the code blocks, please write one or
two paragraphs that explain how the code snippet demonstrates project feasibility.

#### What tasks will you complete after the approval of your project proposal?

TODO: Write a list of at least five tasks that you will complete after the
approval of your project proposal. The steps that you furnish should be in the
order that you will complete them and include technical details about what you
will build and how you will evaluate your progress on each task.

### Learning Objectives

After consulting the [Learning
Objectives](https://securitysynapse.org/syllabus/#learning-objectives) for the
Computer Security course, pick at least two or three of them that **connect to
your proposed computer security project** and write the learning objective in
its entirety below this paragraph. Next, accurately assess your current
attainment of that learning objective on a scale between 1 and 5 where 1
indicates that you are emerging as a learner for the objective and 5 indicates
that you are computer security engineer who expertly completes tasks associated
with the learning objective and are prepared to effectively teach it to others.

### Restatement of Learning Objectives

TODO: Make sure to re-state at least two or three of the learning objectives,
using the correct notation for its label as provided in the syllabus.

### Assessment of Your Current Level of Attainment of the Learning Objectives

TODO: For two of the learning objectives that you stated, please assess your
attainment of the skill described in that learning objective. For the assessment
of your learning objectives, the `First` one will be the one that appears first
above and the `Second` one will be the one that appears after the `First` one.
