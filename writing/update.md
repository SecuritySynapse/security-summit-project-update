## Project Overview

This long-term project invites you to propose, implement, evaluate, and present
your own advanced project in the field of computer security. In addition to
requiring the completion of a significant and innovative software tool, this
project invites you to complete a series of presentations and reports. Your
proposed project should clearly demonstrate a "security synapse" both through
the connection between high-level concepts and their low-level implementation
and technical concepts discussed in the course and their practical application
to the secure use of real-world computer software. You may use external sources,
including artificial intelligence coding assistants and online forums, during
the completion of this project provided that you cite these sources and explain
how you used them to complete the various components of your proposed project.

## Status Update Instructions

Provide a brief status updates about your progress on the security summit
project. Please note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository
has a passing build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have
adequately answered all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to
each of them. It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory
answers to all of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment
of your security synapse project proposal.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive proposal for your security synapse project.

## Security Summit Project Update

### Add Your Name Here

TODO: Make sure to include your name in the above heading.

### Summary Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each proposal task that you completed

TODO: Please do not fill in the checkbox if you did not complete the task

- [] Explored various topics in the field of computer security
- [] Provided an informative title for the proposed project
- [] Gave a list of the overall scientific and engineering goals for the project
- [] Wrote a proposal abstract with both an overview and the expected contributions
- [] Outlined a design, implementation, and evaluation strategy for the project
- [] Furnished a demonstration of project feasibility through code and/or data
- [] Gave a list of tasks that you plan to complete after the proposal's approval
- [] Explained how the project will help you to achieve learning outcomes
- [] Suggested improvement for upcoming modules in the computer security course
- [] Revised and extended the topic outlined in the project proposal

### Project Update

#### What is the final topic that you selected for your security summit project?

TODO: Write one or two sentences that offer an overview of your topic, explain
what you are going to build, and describe how you are going to evaluate it. What
you furnish in this sub-section of the proposal should include a few more
details than the topic list that you provided in the previous sub-section.

- **Chosen Topic**: 

#### What are the ways in which your project's topic evolved since its proposal?

TODO: Write a one-paragraph description of how your project's topic evolved since
you first proposed it. This response should explain how your project's topic
changed from both a high-level perspective and in terms of the specific
technical details that are central to the completion of your project.

#### What are the updated scientific and/or engineering goals for your chosen project?

TODO: Provide a list of at least three goals for your chosen project. Each goal
that you provide should have a clear noun and verb. Whenever it is possible to
do so, please make sure that you do not write any of these goals in passive
voice as that would obscure the overall contributions of your project.

#### What is the update abstract of your project?

TODO: Write a one-paragraph abstract that overviews your proposed project and
the expected outcomes. The content that you write here should be written and
formatted like the abstract of a scientific paper published in an ACM or IEEE
conference in the field of computer security. The one different between an
abstract that you read in a published research paper and this abstract is that
the one you are writing here will reference expected research results and a
published paper will explain the results from a completed study.

#### What parts of your you have already designed and implemented?

TODO: Write a one or two paragraph response to this question. Your response
should highlight the names of the system components that you are going to build,
the way in which you are going to design each specific component, and then a
checklist of steps that you will take to actually implement and test that
component. Whenever possible, please make sure that you state the specific
implementation frameworks, programming languages, and tools that you will use to
design and implement each component in your proposed system.

#### Please pick one source code segment you have already implemented and explain it.

TODO: Using your project's chosen implementation language, please provide a
source code segment in a fenced code block. Then, write at least one paragraph
that explains the key features of the code segment that you have already
implemented. When appropriate, explain what was technically challenging and/or
interesting about the provided source code segment.

#### What is some preliminary experimental evidence arising from your project?

TODO: Write a one or two paragraph response to this question that overviews an
interesting empirical study or experiment that you have conducted. Whenever
possible, your response to this question should furnish data (through a fenced
code block or a table) that supports the claims that you are making about
various aspects of the efficiency, effectiveness, or security of your approach.

#### What tasks will you complete so as to finish your security summit project?

TODO: Write a list of at least five tasks that you will complete after the
approval of your project proposal. The steps that you furnish should be in the
order that you will complete them and include technical details about what you
will build and how you will evaluate your progress on each task.

### Learning Objectives

After consulting the [Learning
Objectives](https://securitysynapse.org/syllabus/#learning-objectives) for the
Computer Security course, pick at least one of them that **connect to
your proposed computer security project** and write the learning objective in
its entirety below this paragraph. Next, accurately assess your current
attainment of that learning objective on a scale between 1 and 5 where 1
indicates that you are emerging as a learner for the objective and 5 indicates
that you are computer security engineer who expertly completes tasks associated
with the learning objective and are prepared to effectively teach it to others.

### Restatement of Learning Objectives

TODO: Make sure to re-state at least one of the learning objectives,
using the correct notation for its label as provided in the syllabus.

### Assessment of Your Current Level of Attainment of the Learning Objectives

TODO: For two of the learning objectives that you stated, please assess your
attainment of the skill described in that learning objective. For the assessment
of your learning objectives, the `First` one will be the one that appears first
above and the `Second` one will be the one that appears after the `First` one.

#### Assessing Current Level of Attainment for the Stated Learning Objective

- [] 1 (**Emerging**): The security engineer is beginning to learn this skill or
concept and needs significant guidance and/or support.
- [] 2 (**Developing**): The security engineer has some understanding but still
needs help and practice to fully grasp the skill or concept.
- [] 3 (**Competent**): The security engineer has a solid understanding and can
independently apply the skill or concept most of the time.
- [] 4 (**Proficient**): The security engineer has a deep understanding and can
consistently apply the skill or concept independently and effectively.
- [] 5 (**Expert**): The security engineer has mastered the skill or concept and
can apply it in complex situations and even teach it to others.

## Course Assessment
